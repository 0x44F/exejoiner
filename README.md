Exe-Joiner (without FUD methods or GUI)

EXE Joiner is a small program that allows you to easily join (bind) two or more files (no matter their type) into one single executable. That executable (the one into which the files are included) is a simple compiled program that, when opened, will automatically launch the included files one by one. Also, it can be used as all types of files converter and encrypter to exe file (**PAID ONLY**).

## Important stuff
This free version (please ‚≠ê) only includes binding of `.exe` Windows PE executable files and does not optimize the stub size.
Do not try to bind other file types as this will result in numerous errors. It also does not include a GUI or any in-built media
player to execute media files unlike the paid version.

## Usage

- Download the source and compile üíæ
```
exejoiner.exe output.exe input1.exe input2.exe
```

The above command would join input1 and input2.exe and the resulting executable file would be stored in output.exe
