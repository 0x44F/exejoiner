Exe-Joiner (without FUD methods or GUI)

EXE Joiner is a small program that allows you to easily join (bind) two or more files (no matter their type) into one single executable. That executable (the one into which the files are included) is a simple compiled program that, when opened, will automatically launch the included files one by one. Also, it can be used as all types of files converter and encrypter to exe file (**PAID ONLY**).
